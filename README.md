# California Housing Prediction

This project uses the California housing dataset to explore and visualize data relationships and build a predictive model for median house values.

## Overview
- Created using Google Colab.
- Data manipulation using NumPy arrays.
- Visualized data distributions and relationships through graphs.
- Generated a heatmap to analyze correlations between variables and the target (Median House Value).

## Dataset
The dataset used is the California housing dataset, which includes various features such as median income, average rooms, and house age.

## Steps Taken
1. Loaded the California housing dataset into a NumPy array.
2. Explored the data by visualizing distributions.
3. Created a heatmap to assess the correlations among different variables and the target variable.

## Future Work
- Implement a machine learning model for predicting house prices.
- Optimize the feature selection process.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
